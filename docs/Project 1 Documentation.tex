\section{Design}
\codename is a simulator for the \textit{Architecture Pipeline EXample} (APEX) Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
\codename consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{main.cpp} contains the driver program. The driver program provides file input for instructions, user interface operations, and maintaining persistent simulator state. This component is discussed in section \ref{sec:driver}.
  \item \texttt{code.cpp}, \texttt{data.cpp}, \texttt{registers.cpp}, \texttt{cpu.cpp}, and \texttt{stage.cpp} provide the objects modeling components of the pipeline. These components are discussed in section \ref{sec:classes}.
  \item \texttt{simulate.cpp} provides the functions that allow the CPU to simulate working on each of its stages, inter-stage communication through advancement, stalls for basic inter-stage interlocks, and forwarding. These implementation details are described in section \ref{sec:implementation}.
\end{itemize}
Figure \ref{fig:overview} shows class interactions and data flow between each of the stages and support classes.
Finally, we opensource our work under the MIT license through a GitHub repository located at \url{https://github.com/colematt/apex-sim}. We discuss our team's work log in section \ref{sec:production}.

\subsection{Driver Program}
\label{sec:driver}
The \codename entry point file is \texttt{main.cpp}. This program shepherds execution through the lifecycle of the program and provides a user interface for interacting with the simulator.
